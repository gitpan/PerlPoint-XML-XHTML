* added the template support the previous version was
  documented to have;
	
* removed attribute targethandle - with templates, files
  can be opened by the template engine, so a general
  handling is not always appropriate;

* added buildFilename() to allow generalized algorithms
  to work - code in this class must work for child
  classes as well;

* added buildTargetLink() to build link targets in one
  place;

* fixed a letter case error - sequence anchor tags were
  written uppercased;
  
* now storing an array reference for each page in the
  slides attribute, allowing using code (like template
  engines) to distinguish pages;

* nested tables now supported;

* added first tests (POD tests only);
